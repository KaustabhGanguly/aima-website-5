# AIMA WEBSITE 5

I am exploring all kinds of ways to test what suits AIMA exercise best . In this project I tested Next.js but I am not satisfied with the React routing for static websites . Till now Hugo is best .

I haven't uploaded the node_modules folder which has 1700 files . It will get automatically installed once you run the code. 

```

npm install --save react react-dom next


```
At the moment Next.js is only supported by Zeit Now Satic Hosting site , so I can't create a github page through it . But it's worth seeing .

I explored this framework to test if it suits AIMA Project or not . Though React is good for dynamic websites , but it's not at all suited for static websites .

This is how it looks without any theme :
