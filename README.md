# AIMA WEBSITE 5
This is the 5th website made for AIMA to showcase my design skills . This website uses NEXT.JS to deploy a static website powered by React  . 


I haven't uploaded the node_modules folder which has 1700 files . It will get automatically installed once you run the code. 

```
mkdir hello-next
cd hello-next
npm init -y
npm install --save react react-dom next
mkdir pages

```
At the moment Next.js is only supported by Zeit Now Satic Hosting site , so I can't create a github page through it . But it's worth seeing .

I explored this framework to test if it suits AIMA Project or not . Though React is good for dynamic websites , but it's not at all suited for static websites .

This is how it looks without any theme :
